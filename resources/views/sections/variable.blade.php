    <h3><b>Variables and Data Types in C Programming Language</b></h3>
    <p>Variables are named storage locations usually determined by the user to store and manipulate data locally. 
    <p>Variables have to be declared first. Variable declaration depends on its data type.</p>
    <p>For example: to declare a variable to store an integer, we use 'int age;'.</p>
    <p>This creates an integer variable named 'age'.</p>
